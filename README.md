# Nextflow Workflows

Welcome to my **Nextflow Workflows** repository! This repository contains various Nextflow-based workflows for bioinformatics data analysis, including RNA-Seq, methylation, exome sequencing, and more. Each workflow is modular, scalable, and built to handle large datasets efficiently in both local and cloud environments.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each workflow is organized in its own subdirectory, with associated scripts and configuration files.

- **README.md** ‚Äì Project overview, key insights, and setup instructions
- **Nextflow Scripts** ‚Äì Main workflow scripts for data processing
- **Config Files** ‚Äì Configuration settings for different environments
- **Docker Images**: Docker is used to create images for each pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and portability of the workflows.
- **Data** ‚Äì Links or sample datasets used
- **Output** ‚Äì Visualizations, logs, and results
- **CI/CD Pipelines** ‚Äì Continuous integration and deployment setup for automatic testing and deployment
- **nf-test** ‚Äì Unit testing for Nextflow pipelines

### üìö CI/CD & Unit Testing

The workflows include **CI/CD** pipelines for continuous integration and deployment, allowing automatic testing, versioning, and deployment of each Nextflow pipeline.

- **CI/CD**: Pipelines are integrated with GitHub Actions and other CI tools like Jenkins or CircleCI for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Unit Testing with nf-test**: The pipelines have unit tests defined using **nf-test**, which ensures that workflows execute correctly and reliably. These tests are part of the CI/CD pipeline to verify each change and prevent bugs in the workflow.

**Key Features of CI/CD & nf-test Integration**:
- Automated unit testing with **nf-test** to validate workflow correctness.
- Continuous integration to test new changes on pull requests.
- Continuous deployment for deploying pipelines to cloud environments like AWS or Kubernetes.
